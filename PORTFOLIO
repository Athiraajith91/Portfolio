Detailed Lesson Plan: Introduction to Python & Printing Output(DAY 1-INTRODUCTION TO PYTHON AND PRINTING OUTPUT)
Lesson Title: Introduction to Python & Printing Output
Grade Level: Beginner (Age 10+ / Coding Beginners)
Duration: 45–60 minutes

1. Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
•	Understand what Python is and where it is used.
•	Describe what a programming language does.
•	Write their first Python program using the print () function.
•	Print text, numbers, and simple expressions in Python.
•	Identify common printing errors (missing quotes, parentheses).

2. Materials Needed
•	Laptop or desktop with internet access
•	Python IDE (Replit / IDLE / Code.org Python Lab)

3. Lesson Introduction (10 minutes)
"Imagine if your computer could understand your instructions exactly like a smart friend. Python is a language that allows us to talk to the computer!"
Explain:
•	Python is a programming language used for apps, websites, AI, and automation.
•	It is easy to read and great for beginners.
•	Today, students will create their first Python program.
Real-life examples of Python usage:
•	Instagram backend
•	Google search algorithms (parts)
•	Robotics & automation
•	Data science and AI models

4. Direct Instruction (15 minutes)
4.1 What is print ()?
•	Python uses the print () function to show output on the screen.
•	Think of it as asking the computer to "say something".
Syntax:
print ("Your message here")
4.2 How to Print Text
•	Text must be inside quotes.
Example:
print ("Hello, Python!")
Output:
Hello, Python!
4.3 How to Print Numbers
•	Numbers do not need quotes.
Example:
print (25)
4.4 Printing Multiple Items
print ("My age is", 12)
4.5 Why Quotes Matter
Explain the difference:
print ("20”) # Text
print (20)    # Number
4.6 Common Errors
Missing Quotes:
print (Hello)
Error: NameError
Missing Parenthesis:
print "Hello"
Error: SyntaxError

5. Guided Practice (10 minutes)
Students try the following with teacher support:
1.	Print their name
print ("My name is Ann")
2.	Print their favourite food
print ("I love biryani")
3.	Print a number
print (2025)
4.	Print a sentence with text + number
print ("I am", 20, "years old")
The teacher checks and corrects errors.

6. Independent Practice (10 minutes)
Students complete small tasks:
•	Task 1: Print 3 sentences about yourself.
•	Task 2: Print your favourite hobby.
•	Task 3: Print any number between 1–100.
•	Task 4: Print this exact output:
Python is fun!

7. Mini Project (5 minutes)
Create a Personal Introduction Program.
Students must include:
•	Name
•	Age
•	One favourite thing
•	One dream for the future
•	A number of their choice
Sample Output:
My name is Rahul.
I am 12 years old.
I love football.
My dream is to become a scientist.
My favourite number is 18.

8. Assessment / Exit Ticket (5 minutes)
Ask students to answer:
1.	What does the print () function do?
2.	Why do we use quotes?
3.	Write a correct Python print statement for:
Welcome to class!

9. Homework
Create a Python script with 5 print statements describing:
•	Your best friend
•	A place you want to visit
•	A number fact
•	A motivational quote
•	Anything funny

10. Teacher Notes / Tips
•	Encourage students to try different variations of print.
•	Remind them: text → quotes, numbers → no quotes.
•	Ask them to read error messages — learning to debug is important.
•	Celebrate their first successful program.
