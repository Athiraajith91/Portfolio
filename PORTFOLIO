•	Python IDE (Replit / IDLE / Code.org Python Lab)

3. Lesson Introduction (10 minutes)
"Imagine if your computer could understand your instructions exactly like a smart friend. Python is a language that allows us to talk to the computer!"
Explain:
•	Python is a programming language used for apps, websites, AI, and automation.
•	It is easy to read and great for beginners.
•	Today, students will create their first Python program.
Real-life examples of Python usage:
•	Instagram backend

•	Robotics & automation
•	Data science and AI models

4. Direct Instruction (15 minutes)
4.1 What is print ()?
•	Python uses the print () function to show output on the screen.
•	Think of it as asking the computer to "say something".
Syntax:
print ("Your message here")
4.2 How to Print Text
•	Text must be inside quotes.
Example:
print ("Hello, Python!")
Output:
Hello, Python!
4.3 How to Print Numbers
•	Numbers do not need quotes.
Example:
print (25)
4.4 Printing Multiple Items
print ("My age is", 12)
4.5 Why Quotes Matter
Explain the difference:
print ("20”) # Text
print (20)    # Number
4.6 Common Errors
Missing Quotes:
print (Hello)
Error: NameError
Missing Parenthesis:
print "Hello"
Error: SyntaxError

5. Guided Practice (10 minutes)
Students try the following with teacher support:
1.	Print their name
print ("My name is Ann")
2.	Print their favourite food
print ("I love biryani")
3.	Print a number
print (2025)
4.	Print a sentence with text + number
print ("I am", 20, "years old")

Day 3 – Input & Basic Expressions
Lesson Title: Input & Basic Expressions 
Duration: 45–60 minutes
Materials: Laptop, Replit/Compiler

Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
•	Use the input () function to take user input.
•	Perform basic arithmetic operations (+, –, *, /, //, %, **).
•	Convert data types (e.g., int (), float (), str ()).
•	Build small interactive programs using input and expressions.

1. Warm-Up – 5 min
Ask students: “How do websites or apps know your name or age?”
Explain: Programs ask users for information using the input () function.

2. Introduction to Input – 10 min
Concept: input () lets the user type something during the program.
It always returns a string.
      Example:
name = input ("Enter your name: ")
print ("Hello", name)
Discuss how input makes programs interactive.

3. Basic Expressions & Type Conversion – 10 min
Introduce operators:
•	Addition (+)
•	Subtraction (-)
•	Multiplication (*)
•	Division (/)
•	Floor Division (//)
•	Modulus (%)
•	Exponent (**)
Explain type conversion: int (), float (), str ()
Example:
age = int (input ("Enter your age: "))
years = age + 5
print ("You will be", years, "in 5 years.")

4. Hands-On Coding – 15 min
Students create a small program using input and operators:
num1 = float (input ("Enter first number: "))
um2 = float (input ("Enter second number: "))

print ("Sum =", num1 + num2)
print ("Difference =", num1 - num2)
print ("Product =", num1 * num2)
print ("Division =", num1 / num2)
The teacher checks if students used the correct type conversion.

5. Challenge Activity – 10 min
Task: Build a Mini Calculator that displays:
•	Addition
•	Subtraction
•	Multiplication
